# Horiseon code refactor

## Description
I have refactored the code for the Horiseon web page to improve the HTML semantics and to provide a more logical structure to its code to improve its SEO and its accessability for the web.

I have improved its alt attributes and title elements so that screen readers and other web accessability tools can read the information on the web page more efficiently. This improves its search engine optimisation and makes it easier for those with disabilities to acces the information on the webpage.

Through this process i have learned that some tags make web pages more informative and adaptable, allowing browsers and search engines to better interpret content. I have also leaned that other tags inhibit this process by not providing adequate information about content and therefore should be changed when possible to improve adapability and useability.

I have also learned a better way to consolidate css to improve its readability and make it more efficient. This means that if anyone was to work on it again in the future, they can read and edit code easily. I now understand the purpose of commenting code to improve this as well.
